# Sample-Data-Generator

Sample Data Generator is a Python-based application that allows users to generate main data about a person, such as their IBAN, Name, and Address, based on a country of their choice. The user can configure the country by editing a file named country_config.txt, specifying the desired Country Code, such as "en_US".

The application uses the "Faker" package to generate realistic and randomized data that matches the specified country. This ensures that the data generated by the application is accurate and relevant to the user's needs.

By using this application, users can quickly and easily generate sample data for testing or demonstration purposes, without the need to manually input data. This can be particularly useful for developers or testers who need to work with a large amount of sample data.
